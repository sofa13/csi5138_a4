# CSI 5138 Homework Exercise 4

Implement and train 3 models: VAE, GAN, WGAN. Train on 2 datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10. Report training behavior against iterations/epochs, plot losses. Visually inspect qualities of the generated images. Tune hyperparameters such as model complexity and latent dimension.

## Jupyter Notebook and Python

This homework makes use of [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) written in python.
